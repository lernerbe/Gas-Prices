# Gas-Prices
Predicts gas prices in Python using time series forecasting

This project leverages historical gas price data to predict future prices using time series forecasting techniques. It reads and processes data from daily.csv and applies advanced machine learning models like ARIMA or Prophet to generate accurate gas price forecasts. The project is built with Python and utilizes libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, making it a valuable tool for analyzing trends and gaining insights into future gas price movements.
